# Text Classification using CNN and LSTM

I have compared the performance of CNN and LSTM models on varied size datasets. The performance is measured on the accuracy achieved and training time required. The datasets used are:
* [Amazon Review dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S1zX-I3Gn2YhZg4Xj6RuOGvOSajHk4tV?usp=sharing)
* [Drugs Review dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VjZ7a52Xr6N99JCr5GsFiBLCk_ocPnoh?usp=sharing)
* [IMDB Movie Review dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WAnbcaLaqVYeMrPy4hFkJHVF8t6yRNvZ?usp=sharing).

## Prerequisites

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Keras
